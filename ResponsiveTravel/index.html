    <h1>Benvenuto to Italy</h1>

    <p>
        Italy is a beautiful country and our company aims to make it an affordable destination for you!
        Our plan is to make sure that your entire trip, from the first airplane ride there to the airplane ride back
        are included in your travel ledger. Booking with us will have you saying, <br> "Sono contento di averlo fatto!" which means
        "I'm glad we did this!" <br><br>
    </p>
    <p style="border-top: 1px solid black; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">
        If you select one of our Introduction to Italian plans, we'll have you translating what the natives
        say before you leave!
