    <h1>This is a page about my hobbies</h1>
    <p>Most of my hobbies include gaming or going out with my friends to do different things.
    I like to golf, play disk golf and play pool. I really only play one game which is League of Legends.
    Other than that, although it's not a hobby I like to hit downtown with my friends on the weekends.
